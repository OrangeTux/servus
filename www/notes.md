This is Wasm according to the official website. To put in my own words: Wasm
defines an Assembly like instruction set. That is it. That is Wasm. End of the talk.

No kidding.

There are several compilers available that can compile source in C/C++/Rust
into a binary containing that instruction set. In order to run that binary
a virtual machine needs to execute the instructions of the binary. Similar
how 'normal' assembly' requires to be executed on a CPU.

Let'
One binary run everywhere? Haven't we have this already with a language as Python or Java?

First of all. Wasm is webstandard, while the others where not.
Java was owned b a company, while Wasm is not. It is driven by several browser
vendors among them Mozilla, Google, Apple and Microsoft.

Wasm is tiny.

Flash and Java where not designed for the web.

Wasm is memory safe

# Why Wasm

Why adding a fourth language to web?



How is diffe


What is not?

WebAssembly is a technology

browserstandard as of ? All major vendors support WASM.
